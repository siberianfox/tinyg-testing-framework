# Preconditions for all tests:
precondition:
  setValuesExample1: # Example of passing it as JSON-style chunks
    # This is the same as the json [{"jv": 1}, {"qv": 1}]
    - {jv: 1}
    - {qv: 1}

  setValuesExample2: # Example of passing it as JSON-style chunks
    # This is the same as the json [{"jv": 1}, {"qv": 1}]
    - {jv: 1}
    - {qv: 1, x: null}

  setValuesExample3: # Another similar example, but without the brackets, since having key: value implies an dictionary
    # The following translates to the javascript [{jv:1}, {qv:1, x:null}]
    - jv: 1 # Note that the space after the colon is necessary!
    - qv: 1 # The -<space> means that this is the next entry in an array
      x: null # **Without** the -<space>, we are adding another key to the same dictionary.

  # Another example: This is the same as setValuesExample2:
  setValuesExample4: [{jv: 1}, {qv: 1, x: null}]

  # Another example: This is the same as setValuesExample2:
